# Prediction-of-Sea-Surface-Temperature-El-Nino
This project focuses on predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variations linked to El-Nino events. Using historical SST data, advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to forecast future SST changes. The goal is to enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities of climatic patterns influenced by El-Nino, aiding in climate research
